Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. 
There are basically two types of IOC Containers in Spring:
BeanFactory: BeanFactory is like a factory class that contains a collection of beans.
ApplicationContext: The ApplicationContext interface is built on top of the BeanFactory interface.
It creates the objects, configures and assembles their 
dependency and manage their entire life cycle. 
The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage 
the components that make up the application. 
IoC container is a framework for implementing automated 
dependency injection. It contains object creation for 
the longer ways to use and injects dependencies within the class.
